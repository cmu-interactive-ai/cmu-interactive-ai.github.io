We are working group led by [PhD students at CMU](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/phd-students) exploring research in interactive AI tools and interfaces.

From time to time, we host guest speakers working and hold paper sharing sessions on the latent research in the field.

Join us in person at [Newell-Simon Hall 4513] (https://maps.app.goo.gl/4uwWcsNJgdwPpRg78) on campus or virtually on Zoom.

Stay tuned for upcoming events on the homepage and feel free to [contact us](mailto:interactiveaiteam@gmail.com) if you are interested in contributing!

<!-- From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens):


>The first wave of AI was about classification, where AI can recognize various types of input data: images, video, audio, language. The second wave of AI is now the generative wave, where you take that input data and produce new data. The third wave of AI will be the interactive phase. -->
