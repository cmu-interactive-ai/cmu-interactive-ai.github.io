We are working group led by [PhD students at CMU](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/phd-students) exploring research in **interactive AI tools and interfaces**. We invite guest speakers and do paper sharing sessions on the latest research in the field.

Stay tuned for upcoming events on the homepage and feel free to [contact us](mailto:interactiveaiteam@gmail.com) if you are interested in contributing! We meet in-person at [Newell-Simon Hall 4513](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4uwWcsNJgdwPpRg78) and virtually.

<!-- >The first wave of AI was about classification, where AI can recognize various types of input data: images, video, audio, language. The second wave of AI is now the generative wave, where you take that input data and produce new data. The third wave of AI will be the interactive phase. --> -->
