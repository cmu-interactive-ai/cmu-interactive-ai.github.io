We are a working group led by [CMU PhD students](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/phd-students) interested in research on **interactive AI tools and interfaces**. We invite guest speakers and do paper sharing on the latest research in the field.

Please see upcoming events on the homepage. We meet in-person at [Newell-Simon Hall 4513](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4uwWcsNJgdwPpRg78) and virtually.

You can reach us at [interactiveaiteam@gmail.com](mailto:interactiveaiteam@gmail.com).
