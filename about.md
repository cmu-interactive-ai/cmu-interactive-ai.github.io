<!-- From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens):


>The first wave of AI was about classification, where AI can recognize various types of input data: images, video, audio, language. The second wave of AI is now the generative wave, where you take that input data and produce new data. The third wave of AI will be the interactive phase.
